Financial Co-pilot
Elevator Pitch: Stop analyzing statements. Start talking to your money.

üöÄ About The Project
Financial Co-pilot is an intelligent, conversational AI assistant developed for a banking hackathon. It empowers users to securely connect to their transaction history and ask complex questions in natural language. Our core mission was to transform tedious financial analysis into a simple, engaging conversation.

The entire application is engineered on a modern, cloud-native stack. We leveraged the power of Google's Gemini AI for its conversational intelligence, built a robust backend with Python and Flask, and containerized it with Docker. The application is deployed and managed on the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), ensuring scalability and reliability.
